            Letflix was first founded in August of 1990 by Abeluzius Markman. The company began out in New Zealand and
            has grown to become one of the world's leading internet entertainment platforms.
            When it first opened, Letflix was a website movie rental service. Users ordered movies on the Let flix
            website, and received DVDs in the post. When they were finished with them, they would simply post them back
            to Letflix in the envelopes provided. Abel started to think that he want to make an application that
            entertain people that can access anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play,
            pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. After that letflix was born.
